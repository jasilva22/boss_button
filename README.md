# boss_button
This code is for a boss button. Extremely popular during March Madness, it allows the user to hit a button (in this case the Enter button) and have their screen be redirected to another page. Handy in case you're watching the game on your desktop at work and your boss walks by. Hit enter and be redirected to an Amazon shopping site for World's Best Boss mug!
